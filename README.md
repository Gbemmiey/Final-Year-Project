<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  A matriculation number is a unique number assigned to every student when he/she matriculates for the first time in the university. It is often referred to as the student ID number present on a student ID card. It can be used for student identification, security, and auditable records. Student ID cards contain varying kinds of identifying information such as matric number, name, phone numbers, addresses, age, and personal details, etc. Several technologies are being utilized in the design of student ID cards such as the use of magnetic stripe (RFID), barcode, QR code, SIM, etc. Although the benefits of linking a card to a broader technical system are significant to minimize the power consumption of the device used to identify the card and invariably enhance the ease of accessing facilities. It is therefore essential that the quality of student ID cards is clear to capture the unique features of identification and should be at a low cost. Therefore, a student identification system was developed to perform optical character recognition on student ID card images to read matriculation numbers and display information retrieved from the database about the recognized matric number using Tesseract OCR. The developed system can be modified for use in several scenarios involving matriculation numbers of students such as in attendance management, amenities access control, etc.
